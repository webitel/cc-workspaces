# NOTES:
# generating changelog for release is performed twice because first changelog generates for release notes,
# so it runs before release step, and second changelog generates for updating CHANGELOG.md file, so it runs after release step.
# if i'd try to generate changelog once, changes will be marked as "master" branch changes, cause there's no new tag yet.
